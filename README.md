# Deepfake-Detection
With the exponential development of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content in today's digital landscape, several urgent challenges have arisen. Among the most alarming are the instances of deep fakes—artificial media where existing images, videos, or audio are altered to produce fake representations. AI-generated forgeries of this kind have the ability to propagate disinformation, influence public opinion, and inflict colossal damage on society. One of the most odious varieties is audio deep fakes, which can mimic an individual's voice with great fidelity, creating the illusion that someone has spoken words they never uttered. Employing sophisticated AI models such as WaveNet and voice conversion techniques, audio deepfakes can reproduce not only the words spoken, but also the intonation, emotion, and rhythm of the original speaker. These models need only brief voice samples to learn an individual's distinct vocal characteristics, after which the system can generate entirely new speech that sounds real. Such a degree of realism makes it particularly challenging to identify audio deepfakes using human auditory perception.
To counter the increasing threat of audio deep fakes, this project endeavors to develop a deep fake detection system specifically for audio media. The system employs deep learning methods combined with signal processing methods to identify small inconsistencies in synthesized audio. With training using an extensive dataset comprising genuine as well as artificially created audio, the model is able to identify valid speech and tampered content. The objective is to develop a reliable system that can be employed in media authentication, fraud detection, and digital forensic purposes—guaranteeing privacy, trust, and information integrity in today's artificial intelligence era.
